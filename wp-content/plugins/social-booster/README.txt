= Can I use Social Media Auto Publish and Schedule Plugin - Social Booster just for one Social Media account or does it require all networks to be set? =
Yes! If you want, you can use the plugin for just one Social Media account.

= Why do I need all those apps? There are other plugins that could do it much easier! =
There is a major difference between "Social Media Auto Publish and Schedule Plugin - Social Booster" and other auto-posting plugins. Plugin MUST use an “App” to make posts. If the plugin doesn’t ask you to create your own app, it will use an app set by plugin author. 
Though it’s easier to setup but it means that with every post you make you will promote that plugin author to all your friends and followers. All those posts will be marked as “Shared via WordPress.com” or “posted by XYZ”. 
Social Media Auto Publish and Schedule Plugin - Social Booster gives you an ability to setup your own apps and promote only yourself. 100% white labeled posts as we promised. So, we have a very detailed and illustrated [setup instructions](http://rextheme.com/docs/how-to-setup-social-media-accounts-with-social-booster/) and our support can help you with that. We believe that it’s better to spend your time by setting it up, instead of doing free advertisement for somebody else.

= Where do you store passwords, usernames and personal data? =
Social Booster neither stores passwords and usernames nor any personal data.
We use the official authentication oAUTH methods to third-party applications provided by the social networks.

= Is the PHP cURL extension required? =
Yes, otherwise the plugin simply won’t function at all.
